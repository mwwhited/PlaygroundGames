If you want to make your own maps you have to save them as map1.txt
Also this program must be unziped as c:\sprites or else it will not work

map notes
G/g = grass/block
C/c = concret/block
S/s = sand/block
N/n = Snow/block
W/w = Water/block (both are blocks)
R/r = Road/block
X/x = Dude Start/Stop
Z   = Monster Start

Currently the monster moves every 300ms and he randomly picks a direction
Also sounds are for furture use.  All of the sprites are windows icons and can be edited with any icon editor


Controls

W = Up
A = Left
S = Down
D = Right

If you need the windows .net framework you can get it here (http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=0856eacb-4362-4b0d-8edd-aab15c5e04f5&displaylang=en)
Also if you have installed any of the .Net 2.0 beta frameworks you will need to uninstall that before you install this new version.  

If you get a “WindowsApplication1” error window check the path and make sure all of the files are in the “c:\sprites” not “c:\sprites\sprites” or anything else.  For now the images are hard coded in the program to that location.
