	Compiling in Code::Blocks on Windows
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Well I wont judge you, but make sure your Code::Blocks installation
	is really up to date - you may even consider updating your C++ toolchain
	to use MinGW32-W64.

	Guide for installing recent GCC for Windows:

	Add these libraries to "Linker Options":
	user32 gdi32 opengl32 gdiplus Shlwapi dwmapi stdc++fs

	Set these compiler options: -std=c++17
